## Project Name

## Summary

This project aimed to empower learners by leveraging AI to generate personalized learning roadmaps. It eliminates the limitations of a one-size-fits-all approach by tailoring learning to individual learning styles. Roadmaps adapt to user preferences, providing a more effective learning experience.

## Demo


## Features ✨

1. **Personalized AI-Generated Roadmaps:** We fine-tuned an OpenAI model to create personalized learning paths.  As of 2023, the learner was required to make  long prompts to be able to get their personalized roadmaps, we eliminated this.
2. **Learning Progress Dashboard:** Access and track all generated roadmaps and monitor learning progress.
3. **Roadmap View Page:** View the details of each generated roadmap.

## Bugs/Future Improvements

1. **Learning Progress Tracking/Management:** Implement features for users to track and manage their learning progress effectively.
2. **UI/UX Responsiveness:** Enhance user experience with a responsive UI/UX design.
3. **User Accounts:** Allow users to create accounts for personalized experiences and data storage.
4. **Cost-Effective Infrastructure:** Consider migrating to a more cost-effective solution like GEMINI.
